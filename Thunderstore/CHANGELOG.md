| 1.8.3     | - Fix the toggle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 1.8.2     | - Epic Loot table now reflects the pulling prevention<br/> - Message above player's head is now different color and bigger. Change the formatting in `[1 - General]` section for the config `Prevent Pulling Format` if you wish to change what it says.<br/> - Add status effect display when the pulling is being prevented as yet another measure that you all pay attention. Display of the status effect is toggleable in the configuration in `[1 - General]` section for the config `Prevent Pulling Status`<br/> - Begin working on making overall improvements to the mod                                                                                                          |
| 1.8.1     | - Surprise surprise, me again. Shortly after the last update I got a message to fix Epic Loot compatibility. Remove check for EnchantingTableUI being visible or not. Let the code run free. I believe, based off what I was told, this also allows spending coins at Haldor's Epic Loot UI from nearby containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.8.0     | - Change the default key for pulling prevention. It's now O + LeftAlt since people keep toggling it and ignoring the message above their player's head. The mod page has been updated to reflect this.<br/> - Jewelcrafting Gem Bags can now be crafted from like a normal container can.<br/> - Updated JewelcraftingAPI and ServerSync internally. <br/> - As I am tired of it being reported as a bug, [Leave One Item] configuration option is now defaulted to Off. I thought about forcing it back on when AzuAutoStore is installed, but figured that might create more issues. Manually toggle it as you want it.                                                                   |

| 1.7.0     | - Update for Valheim latest update (0.220.3)<br/> - Trying something in this update, feedback on how the mod "feels" now and bugs is welcomed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.6.1     | - Updated the README to have the newest configuration additions<br/> - Add a message when pulling prevention logic is toggled. It will display above the player's head.<br/> - Add a configuration option for that message, called `Prevent Pulling Message` found in section `1 - General` of the configuration file. [Azumatt.AzuCraftyBoxes.cfg]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.6.0     | - Fix key input to be more consistent by changing location of execution. <br/> - Change the internal key and initialize to correct value. This should fix issues with defaulting to off. This will fix the issue for everyone, even if you installed the previous update. Overlooked that, my bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1.5.11    | - Fix resource consumption bug introduced recently with the Leave One Item configuration being on.<br/> - Add a new key configuration [Prevent Pulling Logic] that will toggle if you pull from containers or not (Default key is P). The player's inventory and other UI cannot be open in order to toggle this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1.5.9     | - Add ability to filter based on crafting station (checked before containers!). Example YAML is updated as well as readme. This gives the ability to block based on a station the player is interacting with. Useful for mods like Epic Loot.<br/> - Fermenters now pull from nearby containers.<br/> - Accept [PR](https://github.com/AzumattDev/AzuCraftyBoxes/pull/14) from [toddlersizedsharkcage](https://github.com/toddlersizedsharkcage) that prevents errors in scenarios where pieces are modified to have no build requirements.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1.5.8     | - Epic Loot enchanting table compatibility.<br/> - Leave One Item configuration added. (Default is on). Leave one item in the chest when pulling from it, so that you are able to pull from it again and store items more easily with other mods.

| 1.5.0     | - Begin EpicLoot compatibility with the table. I tested this alone, not on a server. You can Enchant and Augment items that are inside of containers now. This doesn't pull the costs from the containers. Still working on that, but if you have the requirements in your inventory, you can enchant items or augment items in nearby chests. I will attempt to add more compatibility with the Enchanting Table soon.

| 1.2.6     | - Add incompatiblity with other Craft from Container type of mods.

| 1.2.2     | - Add compatibility with AdventureBackpacks. Since the container didn't have a creator, I had to make an exception for it. Typically the only containers without a creator are world containers, so it was skipped. Happy Crafting.<br/> - Will probably look into making it compatible with Smoothbrain's Backpack mod soon, if it wasn't already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.2.1     | - Remove the PullToInventory feature as this allows item duplication. This bug isn't an easy one to fix as it requires a server, multiple people (I usually test alone as no one really has the patience) and a decent amount of time. Currently, I am low on time until mid year 2024. If I manage to find a fix, it will be updated to be included again. Sorry for the inconvenience but I hope this at least stops the exploiting for now.<br/> - If you just read that an think that it will take me until mid year 2024 to update, you're incorrect and worried for nothing. Low on time doesn't mean no time, just means my usual super fast updates aren't so super fast anymore :D |
| 1.2.0     | - Hildir Update. Not sure why? Hell, might not fix it for everyone.<br/> - Also, change the version check to be hash check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1.0.7     | - Turns out, some mods just don't populate all expected things on ItemDrops. Added in more null checks and even fix some mod's issues related to the ItemDrop script.

| 1.0.6     | - Update Example.yml file to include the super awesome new features. Add a ton of comments to make even the dumbest of monkeys hopefully understand. Not that you're dumb, just saying...it's stupid simple.<br/> - `It is highly recommended that you regenerate your yml file and reconfigure it!`<br/> - You can now limit what goes into smelters, kilns, fireplaces, and cooking stations. Hopfully I didn't fuck up and the Example.yml is how everyone likes it by default.<br/> - Hope you enjoy this update.                                                                                                                                                                       |
