# Below you can find example groups. Groups are used to exclude or includeOverride quickly. They are reusable lists! 
# Please note that some of these groups/container limitations are kinda pointless but are here for example.
# Make sure to follow the format of the example below. If you have any questions, please ask in my discord.

# Full vanilla prefab name list: https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/prefabs/prefab-list.html
# Item prefab name list: https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/objects/item-list.html

# There are several predefined groups set up for you that are not listed. You can use these just like you would any group you create yourself.
# These are the "All", "Food", "Potion", "Fish", "Swords", "Bows", "Crossbows", "Axes", "Clubs", "Knives", "Pickaxes", "Polearms", "Spears", "Equipment", "Boss Trophy", "Trophy", "Crops", "Seeds", "Ores", "Metals", and "Woods" groups.
# The criteria for these groups are as follows:
# groups:
#   Food:
#     - Criteria: Both of the following properties must have a value greater than 0.0 on the sharedData property of the ItemDrop script:
#         - food
#         - foodStamina
#   Potion:
#     - Criteria: The following properties must meet the specified conditions on the sharedData property of the ItemDrop script:
#         - food > 0.0
#         - foodStamina == 0.0
#   Fish:
#     - itemType: Fish
#   Swords, Bows, Crossbows, Axes, Clubs, Knives, Pickaxes, Polearms, Spears:
#     - itemType: OneHandedWeapon, TwoHandedWeapon, TwoHandedWeaponLeft, Bow
#     - Criteria: Items in these groups have a specific skillType on the sharedData property of the ItemDrop script. Each group corresponds to the skillType as follows:
#         - Swords: skillType == Skills.SkillType.Swords
#         - Bows: skillType == Skills.SkillType.Bows
#         - Crossbows: skillType == Skills.SkillType.Crossbows

#         - Polearms: skillType == Skills.SkillType.Polearms
#         - Spears: skillType == Skills.SkillType.Spears
#            Example:   An item with itemType set to OneHandedWeapon and skillType set to Skills.SkillType.Swords would belong to the Swords group.
#   Equipment:

# By default, if you don't specify a container below, it will be considered as you want to allow pulling all objects for pulling from it.
# If you are having issues with a container, please make sure you have the full prefab name of the container. Additionally, make sure you have exclude or includeOverride set up correctly.
# Worst case you can define a container like this. This will allow everything to be pulled from the container.
# rk_barrel:  
#  includeOverride: []

## Please note that the below containers are just examples. You can add as many containers as you want.
## If you want to add a new container, just copy and paste the below example and change the name of the container to the prefab name of the container you want to add.
## The values are set up to include everything by using the includeOverride (aside from things that aren't really a part of vanilla recipes, like Swords or Bows). 
## This is to give you examples on how it's done, but still allow everything to be pulled from the container.

  includeOverride:
   # - Food # This would not work, you cannot includeOverride a group that is excluded. You can only override prefabs from that group.
    - PickaxeBronze # You can however, be weird, and override a prefab name you have excluded.

# It's highly unlikely that you will need the armor, swords, bows, etc. groups below. These are just in case you want to use them. 
# They were also easy ways for me to show you how to use the groups without actually excluding something you might want to always pull by default.
